## Delivery Fee Calculator

The goal of the assignment was to showcase my coding skills and ability to develop features. This is a highly important part of the hiring process so it's crucial to put effort into this without making it too bloated. Reviewers should put weight on three main aspects: code quality, maintainability, and testing. The task was to write a delivery fee calculator. This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and we’d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

### Specification
Implementation of a HTTP API (single POST endpoint) which calculates the delivery fee based on the information in the request payload (JSON) and includes the calculated delivery fee in the response payload (JSON).

#### Request
Example: 
```json
{"cart_value": 790, "delivery_distance": 2235, "number_of_items": 4, "time": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z"}
```
